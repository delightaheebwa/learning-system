# Static Fixtures & Boundary Cases

## Overview

*(Scope: 'Overview' through 'Boundary Fixture Classes' were ingested 2026-08-06 from Teach C Lesson 2 + Gemini notebook e21b1624e3b156a0. The 'Fixture Tests vs Smoke Tests' section (2026-08-15) is from Gemini notebook e338aa05afbec7a2.)*

A **fixture** is controlled, predictable sample data used as test input. It turns a moving target (live OS text, real user input) into a fixed puzzle. **Boundary/adversarial fixtures** deliberately push the parser outside its happy path to prove it fails cleanly instead of crashing or corrupting.

## Why Fixtures

A parser tested only against real files is tested against whatever the machine happens to produce — you never know what you actually covered. A static fixture gives the test a fixed contract: "given THIS text, output must be THAT". A failure now means the parser, not the environment (see [[Testable Seam]]).

## Boundary Fixture Classes

1. **Format drift** — tabs instead of spaces, multiple leading spaces, different line endings. Real kernels/OS versions format text differently.
2. **Malformed input** — missing headers, truncated lines, extra fields. Parser should return a clean error, not crash or corrupt memory.
3. **Extreme values** — numbers exceeding 32-bit limits (RAM sizes), very long strings, exceeding buffer sizes.
4. **Empty/null input** — zero-byte files handled gracefully.
5. **Cross-platform variants** — Linux 5.x vs 6.x, different distributions → separate fixtures per known format.

## The Production Blind Spot

Fixture assumptions break in production: a kernel update adds or drops stats, a locale changes formatting, a user's config differs. The parser made assumptions that held for *one* fixture but failed on varied inputs. Test with many fixtures — including hostile ones — not one happy path.

## Fixture Tests vs Smoke Tests (2026-08-15)

Two distinct layers for testing a parser that reads live OS files (see [[Testable Seam]]):

- **Fixture tests (deterministic):** feed known static text into the pure parser (`parse_meminfo`) and assert *exact* values — `assert(mem.total_kb == 16384256)`. The input never changes, so the output must be exact.
- **Smoke tests (live/system):** run against the real `/proc/meminfo` via the I/O layer (`read_meminfo`) and assert *range/sanity bounds*, not exact numbers — memory fluctuates between clock cycles, so exact asserts would be flaky. A smoke test is a sanity shield: "did the system layer succeed and return plausible physical bounds?"

Smoke-test invariant pattern (see [[Sentinel Values vs Presence Flags]]):

```c
TEST_CHECK((read_meminfo("/proc/meminfo", &memory) == 0) &&
           (memory.total_kb > 0) &&
           (memory.available_kb <= memory.total_kb));
```

Boundary lessons from this pattern:
- **`total_kb > 0`** guards a downstream divide-by-zero (`100.0 * used_kb / total_kb` crashes when total is 0).
- **`available_kb <= total_kb`** is the true invariant — strict `<` is brittle because `==` is reachable on fresh/controlled systems (no reclaimable overhead).
- A **missing key** (`MemAvailable` absent) with a `{0}` default silently passes `<=` — the missing-field check belongs in the smoke test too.

### Why Exact Live Values Are Flaky (2026-08-18)

`/proc/meminfo` is an **active kernel interface**, not a static config file — background processes allocate memory, release cache, and swap pages every microsecond, and even `MemTotal` can change if memory is hot-plugged in a VM. Across machines/runs (CI runners vs local dev), hardcoding `assert(memory.total_kb == 16384256)` fails on virtually every other machine, even when the code is correct. A smoke test therefore asserts *sanity bounds* (non-zero total, available ≤ total), while deterministic parsing gets exact asserts on fixed **fixtures**.

### Swap Invariant & Edge Case (2026-08-18)

Extending the parser to monitor `SwapTotal:` / `SwapFree:` needs two more rules (added from Gemini notebook ed55c6cdf10c8c2a):

1. **Logical invariant:** `swap_free_kb <= swap_total_kb` — you can never have more free swap than configured total swap (mirrors the RAM invariant).
2. **Zero-swap edge case (disabled swap, `SwapTotal: 0 kB`):** guard `swap_total_kb > 0` before any percentage math, or you get a **division-by-zero** crash computing `100.0 * swap_used_kb / swap_total_kb`. When swap is disabled, skip the percentage (report `0.0% / Not Configured`) — don't crash or falsely fail.

A complete guard block:

```c
// RAM
if (memory.total_kb == 0 || memory.available_kb > memory.total_kb) return TEST_FAILED;
// Swap
if (memory.swap_free_kb > memory.swap_total_kb) return TEST_FAILED;  // corruption

double swap_used_pct = 0.0;
if (memory.swap_total_kb > 0) {
    unsigned long swap_used_kb = memory.swap_total_kb - memory.swap_free_kb;
    swap_used_pct = 100.0 * swap_used_kb / memory.swap_total_kb;
}
```

**Avoid the redundant check:** because `total_kb` is an `unsigned long`, `total_kb >= 0` is *always true* by definition — it passes even when `total_kb` is accidentally 0, so it's a useless guard. The meaningful guards are `total_kb > 0`, `available_kb <= total_kb`, `swap_free_kb <= swap_total_kb`, and `swap_total_kb > 0`.

## One Line Summary

One happy-path fixture proves nothing about production; boundary fixtures prove the parser fails *safely* and *precisely*; smoke tests prove live reads stay within physical sanity bounds.
