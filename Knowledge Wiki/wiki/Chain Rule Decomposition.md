# Chain Rule Decomposition

The chain rule decomposes a complex derivative into a product of **simple local derivatives**. For `y = f(g(x))`:

```
dy/dx = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)
```

The key mental model: **each node in the computation only needs to know two things:**
1. Its own local derivative (e.g., d(a+b)/da = 1, d(a·b)/da = b, d(sin(x))/dx = cos(x))
2. The upstream gradient flowing from the output side

Multiply them and pass downstream. That's it. This decentralized design is why autograd engines scale to arbitrary computation graphs — no node needs global knowledge of the full expression.
