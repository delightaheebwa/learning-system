# Data Augmentation (torchvision)

Medical and agricultural datasets are typically **small** (e.g., 200 cervical cell images). Data augmentation artificially expands your dataset by applying random but realistic transformations.

```python
from torchvision import transforms

train_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=15),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                         std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

# Test: NO augmentation — only normalize!
test_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                         std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
```

## Critical Rule

**Never** apply augmentation to test/validation data. Augmentation is for training only. The test set must represent real, unmodified images that the model would encounter in production.

The ImageNet normalization stats (`mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`, `std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`) are the standard for pre-trained models and should be used with transfer learning.
