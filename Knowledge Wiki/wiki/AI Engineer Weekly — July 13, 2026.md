## The Big Picture — 5 Themes That Kept Showing Up

### 1. Trust Is the New Hallucination

"Hallucination" as a word barely came up this week. The problem has matured into something bigger: **your AI agent confidently ships polished garbage and nobody notices until it's too late.** Elizabeth Fuentes (AWS) showed that prompts alone can't fix this — you need code-enforced guardrails. Sumaiya Shrabony demonstrated that solo agent builders inevitably reinvent CI/CD (badly). Sachin Gupta (eBay) gave us a measurement framework for the accumulating gap between AI-produced code and human-reviewed code. Alex Bauer (Upside) put it plainly: manage your agents like other humans, with commander's intent and independent verification.

**The thread:** Don't trust prompts. Enforce rules in code. Add validation layers. Measure the gap.

### 2. Context Is a Budget, Not a Dumpster

Every token you send to an LLM costs money and degrades accuracy. Three talks independently converged on the same solution: **stop dumping everything into context and start curating.** Elizabeth Fuentes showed semantic tool selection reducing token usage from 3,000 to under 300 per call by filtering 29 tools down to the 3 most relevant. Shashi (Superagentic AI) introduced RLM — Recursive Language Models — where the model writes code in a sandbox to inspect and slice large codebases before deciding what's relevant. Alex Bauer's "Radiant Librarian" pattern gives agents just-in-time memory: documentation, schema, and prior failures consulted before answering.

**The thread:** Treat context like a curated briefing, not a firehose.

### 3. One Agent Is a Liability; Teams Are Architecture

The era of the monolithic mega-prompt is ending. Multiple talks described multi-agent architectures: Elizabeth Fuentes's 3-agent validation swarm (one acts, one checks, one approves), Rushabh Doshi's 39 specialized agents running a factory's entire go-to-market, Alex Bauer's jury-and-judge pattern (multiple independent analysts + consensus judge), and Sumaiya Shrabony's 7-handoff content pipeline. The common pattern: **specialized agents with defined handoffs, each verified by a peer.**

### 4. Review Debt Is Real and Nobody's Measuring It

Sachin Gupta's ReviewDebt talk was the most sobering of the week. GitHub commits climbed 25% YoY while review comments dropped 27%. PR review time is up 441%. Bugs per developer are up 6×. AI produces code faster than humans can review it, and the gap compounds because unreviewed AI code grounds tomorrow's AI suggestions. Alex Volkov's Z/L Continuum talk reinforced this: 31% more PRs merged with zero review. **The solution isn't to stop using AI — it's to route human review attention to what matters** (auth, permissions, money movement, irreversible data) and let automated gates handle the rest.

### 5. Evaluation Needs a Psychometrics Overhaul

Alejandro Vidal (Mindmakers) argued convincingly that we're evaluating models like it's the 1950s — one number per model, treating every benchmark question as equal weight. He introduced Item Response Theory (IRT) to AI evaluation: model difficulty and question difficulty on the same scale, detection of leaked benchmark items, model family identification through residual patterns. The practical takeaway: **you can reduce your private benchmark by 80% with 99% correlation to the full result** by keeping only the most informative items.

## What to Actually Do

### Theme 1: Code-Enforced Guardrails > Prompt Engineering

Stop trying to fix hallucinations with better prompts. Elizabeth Fuentes showed 5 techniques, each a code change:

1. **Semantic tool selection** — Before every agent call, embed the user's query, search a vector store of tool descriptions, and send only the top-3 most relevant tools. (Python: sentence-transformers + faiss, ~50 lines of code.)
2. **Graph RAG** — For aggregation queries ("how many," "average," "count"), replace vector search with a Cypher/SPARQL query against a knowledge graph. The graph computes the answer; the LLM only formats it. (Neo4j + LLMKnowledgeGraph library, free tier available.)
3. **Multi-agent validation** — Three agents in sequence: actor → checker → approver. The checker surfaces errors the actor rationalized away. (Strands Swarm, open source.)
4. **Neuro-symbolic guardians** — Write validation rules as Python hooks that fire before tool execution. "Payment must be verified before booking confirmation" lives in code, not the prompt. Models can't escape Python.
5. **Runtime guardians (steering)** — For soft rules, use Agent Control library. Instead of blocking, the agent self-corrects: "Room max is 10 but you asked for 60 guests → split into 6 rooms."

### Theme 2: Curate Context, Don't Dump It

- **For tools:** Build a tool vector database. Embed all tool descriptions once, search with user query, send top K. Reduces token waste by 90%.
- **For codebases:** Try RLM pattern — give a coding agent its own sandbox, let it write Python to inspect and slice the repo, feed only the relevant chunks to your main agent. (RLM Code on GitHub, open source.)
- **For business data:** Build a "librarian" — a thin layer that stores documentation, schema definitions, and prior query failures. Every agent call consults the librarian first for just-in-time context.

### Theme 3: Build Agent Teams, Not Monoliths

Practical patterns to adopt tomorrow:
- **Swarm pattern:** Actor → Checker → Approver (Strands has this built-in)
- **Jury pattern:** N independent analysts → 1 consensus judge → escalate if disagreement
- **Specialist agents:** One agent = one job. Rushabh's factory uses named specialists (Athena runs the room, Plutus does pricing, Vera fact-checks). No mega-prompt trying to do everything.
- **Handoff gates:** At every agent-to-agent boundary, add a contract check. Sumaiya's 5 gates: shape contract, voice contract, verification contract, deduplication, audit trail.

### Theme 4: Measure Review Debt (Even If You're Solo)

Sachin's 5 deterministic signals you can compute today (no LLM needed):
1. **Diff size & coupling** — Net lines changed, files touched, cross-module sprawl
2. **Test evidence gap** — Test lines ÷ production lines per PR
3. **Directory/ownership spread** — How many code-owner teams touched?
4. **AI authorship indicators** — Co-authored-by footer, branch name patterns
5. **Evidence & rationale gaps** — Does the PR body explain WHY, not just WHAT?

Score 0-100. Bands: 0-24 low burden, 25-49 standard, 50-74 needs evidence from author, 75+ must split.

### Theme 5: Route Review Attention Wisely

Alex Volkov's routing table from the Z/L Continuum:
- **Read every line:** Authentication, money movement, permissions, irreversible data mutations
- **Inspect critical path, sample the rest:** Core business logic, shared utilities
- **Verify behavior, not implementation:** Tests + traces + shadow mode for non-critical code
- **Decompose into atomic PRs:** Agents are great at this — ask them to split before you review
- **Separate writer from reviewer:** Never let the same agent write code AND write tests AND approve

## Top 8 Things You Can Apply Right Now

1. **Add one output gate to any agent you've built.** Shape check: does the output have all required fields before it ships downstream? 20 minutes of Python.
2. **Build a tool vector database for your next agent project.** Sentence-transformers (free, local) + faiss. Filter tools before every agent call. Cuts token costs ~90%.
3. **Route your code review attention.** Auth, payments, permissions, data mutations → read every line. Everything else → behavior-level review (tests + traces).
4. **For aggregation queries, try Graph RAG instead of vector search.** Neo4j AuraDB free tier. "How many X have Y?" goes from "here are 3 samples, I'll guess" to "the Cypher query returned exactly 47."
5. **Split your agent into writer + reviewer roles.** Never let the same agent grade its own homework. Two separate agents with separate prompts.
6. **Write one neuro-symbolic rule in Python.** Pick the business rule you most want enforced ("never confirm booking without payment"). Put it in a Python function that runs before the tool call.
7. **Start tracking your own review debt slope.** Pull 20 of your recent PRs, score them with the 5 signals. Plot weekly. The slope matters more than any single score.
8. **Audit your private benchmark with IRT.** Keep only items with high discrimination (steep curves). Ditch the flat ones. You can probably cut your eval by 80% with no accuracy loss.
