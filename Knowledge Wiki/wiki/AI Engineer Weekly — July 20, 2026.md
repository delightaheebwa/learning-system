## The Big Picture

This week's talks orbit one uncomfortable truth: **the model is the smallest part of the system.** Five separate speakers, from Microsoft to Datadog to ZenML, all arrived at the same conclusion — what you build *around* the model (scaffolding, evals, checkpoints, memory) matters far more than which model you pick. The frontier models are incredible, but the teams shipping reliable AI products are the ones who treat the LLM as a component, not the driver.

Three themes dominated:

**1. Scaffolding beats model size, every time.** Joel Allou and Ornella Bahidika (Microsoft) shipped a voice tutor on Haiku 4.5 — a small model — and got 900ms response times vs. multi-second delays on Opus 4.7. The secret: a state machine that handles all reasoning outside the model, feeding it only what to *say*. Annabell Schäfer (Langfuse) ran the same experiment in a different domain: auto-improvement loops. The biggest accuracy jump (10%) came not from a better model, but from adding rules and examples to the prompt after analyzing error clusters.

**2. Inconsistency is a feature, not a bug.** Diane Lin (Datadog) showed that 25% of agent outputs flip-flop on rerun — and argued this isn't a model failure. It's the model surfacing ambiguity that already exists in your data. Her fix: use disagreement as an active learning signal, then augment with semantic memory (rules) and episodic memory (past examples) instead of expensive fine-tuning.

**3. Agents need infrastructure, not just intelligence.** Hamza Tahir (ZenML) made the case for checkpointing agent state so you can replay and diff what-if scenarios. May Walter (Hud) showed how connecting production runtime data to code-level context lets agents find real performance issues — not just plausible-sounding ones. Sachin Gupta argued agents need feature flags like web services do: canary deploys, kill switches, gradual rollouts. The web stopped shipping to 100% of users in 2012. AI teams haven't caught up.

## By the Numbers

- **900ms** — target response time for voice agents before users perceive a "dead" connection (Microsoft)
- **10% accuracy jump** — from a single iteration of error analysis + prompt update, without changing the model (Langfuse)
- **25% of agent outputs** flip-flop verdict on rerun with the same input (Datadog)
- **15% of inconsistent cases** resolved automatically via episodic memory (Datadog)
- **68% → 83% accuracy** — improvement from a minimal auto-improvement loop on paper classification, using GPT-5 Nano + Claude Opus 4.8 as optimizer (Langfuse)
- **80%+** of agentic PRs feel individually correct but throughput doesn't improve — Google DORA 2026 metrics show AI boosts individual productivity but *not* team delivery stability (Hud)
- **200/100/300** — fit/validate/test split used for the Langfuse auto-improvement experiment, showing even modest labeled datasets can drive meaningful gains

## What to Actually Do

### Theme 1: Scaffolding > Model Size

**The insight:** The model should do one thing well. Everything else — reasoning, state management, decision logic — belongs in code.

**Actionable:**
- For any agent you build, start by listing what the model *shouldn't* decide. Lesson progression? State transitions? Whether an answer is correct? Move those to deterministic code.
- Use a state machine or explicit control flow for multi-step agent tasks. The model gets a summary of current state and only needs to produce the next output.
- Pick the fastest model your latency budget allows, then invest engineering time in the scaffolding. You pay the scaffolding cost once in code, not on every API call.

### Theme 2: High-Signal Evals

**The insight:** "Correctness" on a 1-5 scale is low signal. Binary yes/no questions about specific quality criteria are high signal.

**Actionable:**
- Replace vague evaluators like "Is this helpful? (1-5)" with concrete checks: "Is the answer grounded in the retrieved context? Yes/No." "Did we use the correct brand name? Yes/No."
- Create a labeled dataset — even 200 examples with ground truth labels is enough to start an auto-improvement loop.
- Run your agent multiple times on the same input. Where outputs disagree, you've found your gray zone — those are the highest-ROI data points to label and clarify.
- Validate prompt changes on a held-out set before deploying. The Langfuse experiment showed generalization from 200 fit examples to 300 unseen test examples held up well.

### Theme 3: Production Observability for Agents

**The insight:** Traces tell you *what* happened. You need checkpoints to ask *what if*.

**Actionable:**
- Add checkpointing to your agent harness — save the full state (variables, tool call inputs/outputs, environment) at each step. This lets you replay from any point with different parameters.
- Before swapping to a cheaper model, replay a cohort of production runs at that checkpoint and diff the results. Single-replay anecdotes lie; cohort analysis doesn't.
- For coding agents: connect production metrics (latency, errors, throughput) to function-level context. An agent that only sees code can guess; an agent that sees "this endpoint takes 45s when Mongo's distinct operator runs without the search index" can fix.

### Theme 4: Memory Over Fine-Tuning

**The insight:** Fine-tuning is expensive and slow. Semantic memory (rules) + episodic memory (past examples) is lighter, faster, and easier to iterate.

**Actionable:**
- Build a knowledge base of domain rules (semantic memory): "If password spray without successful login → benign. If password spray with successful login → malicious."
- Store past agent decisions with their inputs and let new runs reference similar cases (episodic memory). This automatically resolves recurring patterns without human intervention.
- Only escalate to human review when neither memory type has a match — this is the efficient quality control loop.

### Theme 5: Agent Infrastructure Patterns

**The insight:** Agents need the same operational maturity web services got a decade ago.

**Actionable:**
- Put feature flags on agent behavior changes. Ship prompt updates to 5% of users first, not 100%.
- Automate the investigation phase for production issues — weekly scans for high-ROI performance fixes, scored by business impact and risk.
- Design agent outputs for human review: a short, readable summary of what changed, why, and evidence it works. Not 80 auto-generated PRs.

## Top 8 Things You Can Apply Right Now

1. **Move reasoning out of the model.** For your next agent project, implement a state machine that handles all decision logic. Feed the model only what it needs to say or generate. This cuts latency and cost immediately.

2. **Create 3 binary evaluators for your current project.** Not "rate quality 1-5." Specific yes/no checks: "Did it reference the correct API?" "Is the output in the right format?" "Did it hallucinate a function that doesn't exist?"

3. **Run your agent 3x on the same 10 inputs.** Where outputs disagree, you've found your eval dataset. Those are the examples worth labeling.

4. **Build a tiny ground-truth dataset.** 200 labeled examples with clear right/wrong answers is enough to start an auto-improvement loop. You can get there in an afternoon.

5. **Add checkpointing to one agent.** Save state at each tool call. Next time you want to test a model swap or prompt change, replay from those checkpoints instead of running fresh.

6. **Do a cohort replay before any model change.** Don't trust a single replay. Take 50 production runs, replay with the new model, and diff the results. The ZenML/DoorDash case study showed 90% fewer hallucinations from this approach.

7. **Set up disagreement-based monitoring.** Track when your agent gives different answers on reruns. Those are your highest-signal improvement opportunities — and they'll tell you where your labeling is ambiguous.

8. **Add a kill switch to your next agent deploy.** Feature flag the new behavior. If something breaks, you flip it off — no redeploy, no rollback, no panic.
