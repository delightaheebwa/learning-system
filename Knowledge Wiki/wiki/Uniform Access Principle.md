# Uniform Access Principle

From Bertrand Meyer's *Object-Oriented Software Construction*: all services offered by a module should be available through a **uniform notation** that does not reveal whether they are implemented through storage (a field) or computation (a method).

## Core ideas

### Accessor functions
Always use getter and setter functions (methods) to read and write object attributes, rather than exposing raw data structures directly. This prevents **coupling** — if you change the internal data structure later, external code that used accessors doesn't break.

### Uniform notation
The caller shouldn't know (or care) whether `user.name` returns a stored field or computes it on the fly. The syntax looks identical either way. This gives you freedom to change the implementation behind the scenes.

## Modern implementation: Properties

Languages like Python (`@property`), JavaScript (get/set), Swift, and C# implement Uniform Access through properties. You can start by exposing a plain variable, then later turn it into a property with caching, validation, or computation — without breaking any calling code.

## When to skip it

**Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Simple data buckets with no behavior, no caching, no logic. These are just containers for moving data between layers (e.g., database → webpage). Accessors add unnecessary ceremony here.
