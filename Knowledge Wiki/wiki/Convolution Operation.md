# Convolution Operation

A **convolution** slides a small filter (kernel) across the image. At each position, it multiplies the filter values by the overlapping image pixels and sums them up. The result is a **feature map** — a new image where bright spots show where the filter detected its pattern.

CNNs solve two fatal problems with fully-connected networks on images:
1. **Too many parameters** — a 256×256×3 image → 196,608 inputs → 196M params for one hidden layer
2. **No spatial awareness** — a pixel shifted one position is treated as a completely different feature

```python
import torch.nn as nn

conv = nn.Conv2d(
    in_channels=3,      # RGB → 3 input channels
    out_channels=16,    # 16 different filters
    kernel_size=3,      # each filter is 3×3
    stride=1,           # slide 1 pixel at a time
    padding=1           # preserve spatial size
)
```

Each filter learns to detect a different pattern (edges, textures, blobs). Early layers detect low-level features; deeper layers detect higher-level patterns (cell morphology, lesion shapes).
