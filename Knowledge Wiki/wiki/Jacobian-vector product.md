# Jacobian-vector product

A Jacobian-vector product, or JVP, is the product \(J_f(x) r\): the Jacobian of \(f\) at \(x\) applied to a direction vector \(r\).

## Why it matters

- It gives the effect of one chosen input direction without forming the full Jacobian.
- It is the quantity computed by forward-mode automatic differentiation.
- It is practical when the input dimension is large but you only need a few directions.

## Connection to directional derivatives

- A JVP is the same thing as a directional derivative written in matrix form.
- If \(r\) is a coordinate basis vector, the JVP reduces to a partial derivative.
