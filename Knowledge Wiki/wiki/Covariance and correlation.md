# Covariance and correlation

Covariance and correlation describe how two random variables move together.

## Covariance

Covariance measures whether two variables tend to increase and decrease together.

- Positive covariance: they tend to move in the same direction
- Negative covariance: they tend to move in opposite directions
- Near zero covariance: little linear relationship

## Correlation

Correlation is a scaled version of covariance.

- It is normalized so the result always lies between −1 and 1.
- That makes it easier to compare relationships across different units.

## Why it matters

Covariance tells you about joint variation, while correlation tells you the same story on a standardized scale.

## In NumPy

`np.cov` computes the sample covariance with the `1/(n-1)` normalization, so the sample count appears **only inside the entries** — never as a matrix dimension.

- `np.cov(Xc, rowvar=False)` — each **column** is a variable (features-as-variables), giving a `d×d` matrix for `d` features. This is the layout the PCA recipe assumes.
- The **default is `rowvar=True`**: each *row* is a variable. On a points-as-rows matrix the default silently builds the covariance along the wrong axis (an `n×n` object of point-pairings).
- The result is square and symmetric; a single variable comes back as a 0-d scalar, not a `1×1` matrix.

See [[PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)]] for how this matrix is decomposed.
