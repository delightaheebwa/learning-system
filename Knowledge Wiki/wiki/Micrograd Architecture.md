# Micrograd Architecture

A five-level hierarchy that builds from a single scalar autograd Value to a full neural network training loop:

1. **Value** — scalar storing data, grad, _prev (children = the graph), _backward (local derivative), and _op label. The autograd engine.
2. **Neuron** — w·x + b → tanh. One weighted sum + activation.
3. **Layer** — list of Neurons. Parallel computation.
4. **MLP** — list of Layers. Sequential depth.
5. **Training Loop** — forward → loss.backward() → update → repeat.

Each level is built entirely on the one below it. PyTorch's architecture follows the same pattern — tensors instead of scalars, modules instead of neurons, but the exact same structural hierarchy.

**Key insight:** the hardest part (Level 1 — the autograd engine) is already done. Levels 2-5 are composition and training infrastructure.
