# Gradient Checking

Comparing autodiff gradients against numerical finite-difference approximations to verify the backward pass is correct. The core method: compute the central difference f'(x) ≈ (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2h) with h ≈ 10⁻⁶, giving O(h²) accuracy. Compare against autodiff gradient; if the difference exceeds a tolerance (~10⁻⁵), there's a bug in a backward rule.

**When to use:** every time you implement a new operation's backward pass. Every major framework (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow) has gradient checking in its test suite.

**Key insight:** gradient checking catches silent bugs — mismatches where autodiff produces wrong gradients that would corrupt training without any visible error.
