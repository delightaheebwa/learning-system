# Neural Network Training Loop

The complete cycle that every deep learning framework implements: (1) **Forward pass** — compute predictions and loss; (2) **Backward pass** — loss.backward() computes gradients for all parameters via autodiff; (3) **Parameter update** — w -= lr × w.grad (gradient descent step); (4) **Zero gradients** — reset all .grad values to 0 before the next iteration.

In equation form: θ ← θ - η·∇θL(θ), repeated thousands of times over batches of data. The backward pass and update step are what the autograd engine enables.

**Key insight:** this loop IS training. Everything else — architectures, loss functions, optimizers — are variations built on this foundation. In micrograd, the full loop is ~10 lines of pure Python.
