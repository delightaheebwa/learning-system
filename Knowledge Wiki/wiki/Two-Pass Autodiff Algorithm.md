# Two-Pass Autodiff Algorithm

Every autodiff system follows the same two-pass algorithm:

1. **Forward Pass** — Compute every node's value in topological order from inputs → output. Build the computational graph implicitly by recording which values produced which outputs.

2. **Backward Pass** — Seed `output.grad = 1.0` (since ∂output/∂output = 1), then walk through the graph in reverse order. At each node, compute `grad_to_children = local_derivative × upstream_gradient`.

This is the universal algorithm behind backpropagation. For `y = sin(x²)`:
- Forward: x=2 → a=x²=4 → y=sin(4)≈-0.7568
- Backward: dy/dy=1 → dy/da=cos(4)×1≈-0.6536 → dy/dx=2x×(-0.6536)≈-2.6146
