## 1. The Big Picture

This was the AI Engineer World's Fair dump — 30+ talks dropped in a single week. Across the 8 most signal-dense ones, five themes kept showing up:

**Evals are still the open wound.** Barr Yaron's State of AI Engineering survey put it bluntly: 96% of respondents have a problem with their stack, and evals are #1 by a thin but persistent margin. "Vibe review" remains the dominant evaluation method. DSPy's team framed it differently — the same problem from the solution side — arguing that specs, code, and evals need to be defined as a programmatic interface before you can auto-optimize anything. The gap between "we know evals matter" and "we have good evals" is still where AI engineering goes to die.

**Agents got write access. Guardrails didn't catch up.** The survey numbers are stark: 95% of teams are using agents (double last year), and 89% of those agents have write permissions (up from 52%). That's a 3x increase in write-enabled agents year-over-year. The control mechanisms? Still "human in the loop approvals and gating permissions" — the same toolkit you'd use to manage an intern. Nobody has settled the control layer.

**Decouple or die.** This showed up in three separate talks with three different framings. Dan Farrelly (Inngest) argued for separating the execution layer (the brain) from the context layer (the knowledge). DSPy's team argued for separating the task signature from the model implementation. ZS Associates argued for separating deterministic signal detection from agentic reasoning. Same insight, different angles: the parts that change fast (models, prompts, tools) need to be isolated from the parts that should be stable (execution, state, contracts).

**Multi-agent is overrated. Single-agent with delegation wins.** ZS Associates built a 4-agent pipeline mimicking human analyst behavior — one agent per reasoning step. It failed because context got lost at every handoff. They rewrote it as a single reasoning agent that delegates investigations to sub-agents but owns the judgment. The knowledge graph became a control plane, not a lookup table. Jason Liu at OpenAI described the same pattern with Codex: one pinned "chief of staff" thread that spawns sub-agents for focused work.

**Cost is now a first-class engineering constraint.** 40% of survey respondents say cost regularly shapes how ambitious their AI usage is. Another 36% say it sometimes does. Token usage is the #2 thing monitored in production, right under quality. Jason Liu hammered this practically: stop defaulting to max reasoning. Low and medium thinking modes are still "so much better than prior models" for most tasks.

## 2. 🔴 MUST WATCH

**1. [Full Workshop: Setting Yourself Up for Success — Jason Liu, OpenAI Codex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il1c1a2FufU)**  
This is not a talk — it's a 75-minute workshop where Jason walks through his actual Codex setup, live. Pinned threads as teammates, memory vaults, skill creation, automations that wake threads up, threads talking to threads. The concepts alone are useful, but watching him demo appshots, voice dictation with a foot pedal, and thread-to-thread delegation in real time is the kind of thing that rewires how you think about what's possible. If you watch one talk this week, make it this one.

**2. [Why We Killed Our Multi-Agent Pipeline — ZS Associates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6jJcIFDLE4)**  
A real production story with concrete before/after architecture. They built a 4-agent pipeline that produced factually correct but incoherent outputs because no single agent owned the end-to-end reasoning. The fix — consolidating to one reasoning agent with a knowledge graph as a control plane — is much easier to understand when you see the architecture diagrams side by side. The "knowledge graph is not a lookup, it's a control surface" insight is the kind of thing that's obvious once you see it drawn out.

## 4. What to Actually Do

### Theme 1: Fix your eval situation — or at least start

DSPy's framework gives you a concrete path: define your task as (1) what should happen (instructions/signatures), (2) what must happen (code constraints), and (3) what good looks like (examples/evals). Once you have those three, you can start auto-optimizing. The Shopify case study — 550x cost reduction by just swapping models under the same signature — only works because they had an eval to measure against.

Action: Take one AI task you run repeatedly. Write down the input type, output type, and 3 examples of "good" output. That's your minimal eval. Now you can A/B test models, prompts, or architectures against it.

### Theme 2: Decouple your architecture

Dan Farrelly's three-layer model is the most actionable framing:
- **Execution layer** (brain): flow, state, durability, retries — stable, invest here
- **Context layer** (knowledge): models, prompts, tools, memory — changes weekly
- **Compute layer** (hands): sandboxes, browsers — increasingly commoditized

If your prompt logic is tangled with your retry logic, you can't swap either one. The ZS team's failure case is the cautionary tale: they coupled reasoning distribution across agents and lost coherence. The fix was consolidating reasoning into one agent and letting the execution layer handle delegation.

Action: Look at any agent you've built. Can you swap the model without touching retry/state logic? If not, you've coupled layers.

### Theme 3: Stop defaulting to "max reasoning"

Jason Liu was blunt: "X-high does not equal X-high results." His chief of staff thread runs on default medium. Lance Martin showed that frontier models on lower reasoning + a verifier loop outperform max-reasoning single-pass. For most tasks that aren't "build me a video game from scratch," low and medium thinking modes are more than enough.

Action: Next time you reach for the most expensive model/tier, ask: would a cheaper model with a verification step work? Test it. The cost difference compounds fast.

### Theme 4: Build agents that own their memory

Lance Martin's key finding: let the model manage its own memory structure. Don't prescribe a memory schema. Higher-capacity models are significantly better at knowing what to abstract and save for future sessions. His "dreaming" concept — an offline process that reviews session traces and consolidates/corrects memories — is worth stealing for any long-running agent system.

Action: If your agent writes to memory, don't pre-define the categories. Give it a file system or DB and let it organize. Then occasionally run a separate "review" pass that reads traces + memory and suggests corrections.

### Theme 5: Use the right tool for the deterministic parts

ZS's original pipeline had an LLM deciding what counts as a signal — basically pattern-matching on sales data. They replaced it with pure statistical methods (thresholds, guardrails, anomaly detection) and only woke up the agent when a signal was confirmed. Don't burn tokens on things a SQL query or statistical test can handle.

Action: Audit your agent pipeline. What steps are doing pure computation or pattern-matching? Pull those out into deterministic code. The agent should investigate signals, not detect them.

## 5. Top 8 Things You Can Apply Right Now

1. **Write a 3-part eval for one AI task you run repeatedly** (DSPy method: instructions + code constraints + examples). You can't optimize what you can't measure.
2. **Separate your agent's execution logic from your prompt/model logic.** If you can't swap models without rewriting retries, fix that first.
3. **Default to medium reasoning for non-heroic tasks.** Track your token spend for a week. You're probably over-provisioning.
4. **Extract deterministic steps from your agent pipeline.** If an LLM is doing arithmetic, pattern matching, or threshold checking, replace it with code.
5. **Don't pre-define memory schemas for agents.** Give them a file system or DB, let them organize. Run occasional offline memory review passes.
6. **Try a verifier loop pattern:** build agent + verify agent, loop until verification passes. This outperforms single-pass on long-horizon tasks.
7. **Use HTML/CSS/JS when you need agents to produce visual output.** HyperFrames shows it works better than teaching them a custom DSL.
8. **Pin a thread and give it a heartbeat.** Codex automations show that a thread checking in every 30 minutes is more powerful than one-shot agent calls.
