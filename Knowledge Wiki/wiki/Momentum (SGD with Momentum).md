# Momentum (SGD with Momentum)

Momentum accumulates past gradients into a velocity term instead of stepping on the current gradient alone:

- \(v \leftarrow \beta\,v + g\)
- \(w \leftarrow w - \eta\,v\)

with \(\beta\) typically 0.9 (keep 90% of last step's velocity, add the new gradient).

## Why it works (beyond the ball analogy)

The "heavy ball rolling downhill" picture is a fine intuition but an oversimplified cartoon (Goh, Distill 2017). The deeper mechanism: in a narrow valley, the cross-valley gradient oscillates in sign — so opposite-sign contributions **cancel** in the velocity sum — while the along-valley gradient is small but consistent, so it **accumulates**. Momentum is a selective accumulator: it keeps what is consistent and averages away what zigzags.

Geometrically, this rescales the effective step size per eigenvector direction of the Hessian, equalizing convergence rates across directions of different curvature.

## Notes

- Higher \(\beta\) = smoother paths but slower response to direction changes.
- The first step from zero velocity is identical to plain GD — momentum's advantage compounds over steps.
- Different lineage from adaptive methods (Adam tracks squared gradients too; see [[Optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW)]]).
