# Pooling (MaxPool2d)

After a convolution, **pooling** downsamples the feature map. **Max Pooling** slides a 2×2 window and keeps only the maximum value in each window.

```python
pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
# [batch, channels, H, W] → [batch, channels, H/2, W/2]
```

Only height and width change — channel count stays the same.

## Three Purposes

1. **Reduces parameters** for the final classifier layers
2. **Translation invariance** — a lesion shifted slightly produces the same pooled output
3. **Increases receptive field** — each pixel in deeper layers "sees" more of the original image
