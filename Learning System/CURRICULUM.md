# Curriculum — AI Engineering from Scratch (Rohit)

> Authoritative "what's next" map, aligned to **AI Engineering from Scratch** by Rohit Ghumare (https://github.com/rohitg00/ai-engineering-from-scratch).
> Source of truth for order is upstream `ROADMAP.md` (cached SHA at time of switch: `main` 2026-09-01). Rohit's `docs/en.md` per lesson is **a source, not the source** — Scout gathers `docs/en.md` + every link in its `## Further Reading` plus curated `RESOURCES.md` entries.
> One mission per roadmap phase (plus Mission 0 Catch-Up). Lessons within a mission are **sequential** — one at a time. Interleaving lives only in the review flow. One curriculum lesson = one runnable artifact (see Rohit "Every lesson ships something"). Status `not-started` → `in-progress` → `done`. A lesson is `done` only after practice + retrieval + Feynman explain-back.
> **Adaptive rule:** before each new lesson, Scout re-fetches the live `phases/<NN>-<phase>/<NN>-<lesson>/docs/en.md` and its Further Reading URLs, compares to cached hash, and surfaces any delta in `SCOUT DIGEST: ⚠️ Upstream changed`. Tutor prefers live combined sources over parametric memory. See `Learning System/MISSION.md` and `Skills/learning-teach/SKILL.md`.
> **Language rule:** build language per lesson follows Rohit's `Languages:` header (Python / TypeScript / Rust; Julia optional). Phase default is in the mission header; lesson-level overrides apply. See `RESOURCES.md`.
> **Scope note:** full 20-phase map is present for navigation; it is not a contract to finish end-to-end. After each phase, decide to go deeper / branch / build a learning system around a topic. Archived SWE roadmap: `Learning System/Archive/CURRICULUM — SWE Primary Colors — archived 2026-09-01.md` and wiki banner; `📦 Concept Archive.md` holds paused SWE rows (visibility strictly out of scope — Scout/Tutor do not grep it).

## Mission 0 — Catch-Up: Foundations Reactivation *(special · done)*

Goal: **80/20 reactivation** of everything up to and including **Phase 1, Lesson 06 — Probability & Distributions**. You did Phase 0 + P1.01–06 before (exercises done) but haven't reviewed in weeks. This lesson rebuilds the 20% that unlocks 80% of later phases, probes for gaps, and sets `next` to Phase 1 Lesson 07.

- **Source:** Phase 0 (12 lessons) + Phase 1 L01–L06 synthesized from Rohit `phases/00-setup-and-tooling/*/docs/en.md` + `phases/01-math-foundations/01-*` through `06-probability-and-distributions/docs/en.md` plus each lesson's `## Further Reading` (external).
- **Lang:** Python (Julia notes for L01 where Rohit lists it, but Python-first).
- **Probe:** 6–8 MCQs + 2 free-recall, broad→narrow, confidence-tagged, `quiz-audit` gated — locate edge per strand (tooling / linear algebra / calculus / probability).
- **80/20 map (taught in this catch-up):**
  - **Tooling mental model:** 4-layer stack (System → Packages → Runtimes → AI libs); `uv`/`venv`, `verify.py --route`, `nvidia-smi` vs `torch.cuda.is_available()` / MPS, `.env` + `.gitignore` for keys.
  - **Vectors/Matrices:** vectors as points, magnitude, dot product = similarity, matrices as transforms, shape `(m×n)@(n×p)`, broadcast `W@x+b`, dense layer `relu(Wx+b)`, rank/basis intuition.
  - **Transformations/Eigen:** rotate/scale/shear, composition non-commutative, determinants as volume scale, `Av=λv` as fixed directions.
  - **Calculus substrate:** derivatives/gradients, chain rule as engine for backprop, autodiff forward vs reverse intuition.
  - **Probability core:** axioms, conditional `P(A|B)`, independence, **PMF vs PDF**, Bernoulli/Categorical/Normal (68/95/99.7), `E[X]` / `Var = E[X²]-μ²`, **CLT = why normals dominate**, log-probs & `log-sum-exp` trick, **softmax (subtract-max) + cross-entropy = −log P(correct)**.

| # | Lesson | Est. time | Prereqs | Lang | Status | Notes |
|---|--------|-----------|---------|------|--------|-------|
| 0 | Catch-Up: 80/20 Foundations (Tooling → Probability, P0 + P1.01–06) | ~90 min | none | Python | done | Special reactivation. Probe first, then teach gaps. On pass → jump to Phase 1 L07. Source: P0–P1.06 `docs/en.md` + Further Reading synthesis. |

**Exit:** you can state the 4-layer env stack, explain `Wx+b` with shapes, distinguish PMF/PDF, and derive cross-entropy from NLL without notes.

## Rules

1. Lessons strictly sequential within a mission; missions in phase order (0→19). Mission 0 Catch-Up is prerequisite to Phase 1 L07; Phase 0 individual lessons are covered by that catch-up and may be retrieval-checked, not re-taught.
2. Scout, before each **new** lesson: fetch live `phases/<phase>/<lesson>/docs/en.md` + **every URL in its `## Further Reading`** (+ `RESOURCES.md` curated), hash, compare to digest cache, surface drift (`SCOUT DIGEST: ⚠️ Upstream changed`). Rohit is a source, not the source.
3. New concepts enter `Core/📚 Active Concepts.md` on first introduction (status `developing`, `last_reviewed` today, `next_review` +3d), exactly like ingest. Scout/Tutor grep **only** `📚 Active Concepts.md` + `RESOURCES.md` + curriculum — `📦 Concept Archive.md` is strictly out of scope (SWE archived).
4. A lesson marked `not-started*` (covered by catch-up) is retrieval-checked, never re-taught; on fail demote to `in-progress`.
5. Advancement requires: practice complete + retrieval pass + Feynman explain-back (Learning Record, Bloom level noted).
6. **Language:** per-lesson `Languages:` header (Rohit) decides build language (Python / TypeScript / Rust; Julia optional). Phase default is fallback; do not default everything to Python.
7. Interleaving only in review flow (SRS shuffle + adjacency + question-type alternation) — never inside lessons/quizzes.
8. Full 20-phase map is navigational, not contractual. After each phase, decide to go deeper / branch / build. Cache is ignored per decision 2026-09-01 (live fetch each lesson; no phase cache layer).
